Here, I have used six different Neural Network models to analyze and estimate price / performance of stocks and train them with Hybrid data made with Number data (i.e. 17 years ago Prices / TCS (Tata Consultancy Service)) and text data (ie data of Indian news media).
WI obtained the accuracy of each model as described below:



AdaBoost Model: 85.35849908490619%
Gradient Promotion Model: 85.5213615950851%
Logistic Regression Model: 83.22032395127025%
Random forest model: 81.19986132499133%
Decision tree model: 79.30759245672454%
Line Discrimination Model: 83.4484927155308%

Finally, we can clearly see that the Gradient Boosing Model gives more accuracy (i.e. 85.5%) compared to all other models. Neural Network models.
